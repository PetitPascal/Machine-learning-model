## Purpose
This repository contains **trained machine learning models** generated as part of different scientific studies.
The goal is to support **reproducibility**, **transparency**, and **external validation** of published research by making the final models openly accessible.

Each study has its own folder containing one or more trained models.
Models are GDPR-compliant and do not include raw, sensitive or personal data.

Each study has its own folder containing one or more trained models.  
No raw or sensitive data is included.

This repository contains **only** the trained models from the studies.

## GDPR and Privacy Compliance

This repository is fully **GDPR-compliant**.

- No personal data, raw datasets, or identifiable information are stored in this repository.  
- The machine learning models included here do **not** store or embed the training data used to create them.  
- Only the model parameters (e.g., coefficients, split rules, tree structures) are saved.  
- Any elements of model objects that could contain data (e.g., model frames) were removed before upload, where applicable.

These models can therefore be shared publicly without risk of revealing any sensitive information.
